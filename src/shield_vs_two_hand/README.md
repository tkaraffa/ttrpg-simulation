## Interpretation

With just the Great Weapon Fighting feature, the Great Sword clearly performs better than the Great Axe, and, unsurprisingly, benefits more from the feature.

Despite the surface-level attractiveness of using a greataxe with Brutal Critical, the Great Sword ultimately performs better across levels and opposing Armor Classes, except against exceptionally high ACs, where the difference between each weapon is negligible.
